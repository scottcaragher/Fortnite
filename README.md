# FORTNITE

## Introduction

I set out to create a choose your own adventure based on the video game Fortnite. I decided to pursue this because I wanted to create a game from scratch where I could creatively write numerous unique scenarios that contained a probability of surviving or dying. I've spent countless hours watching youtube videos or searching up code on how to help produce my vision. I wrote 10 different quests where each one is designated to a certain landing spot on the map. The game begins with an updated Fortnite map and a box asking the user where to land in Turtle. The Pygame window displays the story line of text but when the game asks for the user's decision, the input window is displayed on the turtle screen. This game is mainly for user's who already play Fortnite but if you only know of the game then you must be a quick learner. 

## Code Samples

{text = "Along the way you collect some wood material to build later on."  
{text = "There are 10 other players remaining."  
{text = "Someone starts shooting at you from 50 yards away, you immediately build up a fort."  

{myDialogueQuestAC = screenText.textinput("Fortnite", "1. Use your sniper? Or 2. Assault Rifle? Please Choose 1 or 2.")

This is an example of a small scenario of whether the user wishes to use a sniper or an assault rifle. The sniper has the range and accuracy but the firing rate is very slow. The assault rifle has decent range, fast firing range, but not as powerful as a sniper. What do you use?

## Installation

Add all the files into Visual Studio Code and you may have to copy and paste each quest after line 61 if the import of the file does not go through.
